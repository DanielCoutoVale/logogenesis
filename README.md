Logogenesis
===========

An Application Programming Interface (API) for both hollistic (systemic and formalist) and reductionist (only formalist) approaches to automatic linguistic analysis of wordings. Currently, the API contains a holistic wording segmenter and a reductionist one and also methods for importing and exporting wording segmentations (Couto-Vale, forthcoming).
